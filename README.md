# gui-python
This repository is for learning tkinter based apps

So I've been meaning to learn more about python and I did learn the core modules, but I feel its time to take the next step.

Before delving into the web based applications I would like to get some expertise on building gui applications. First using tkinter, the default gui library, then using PyQt.

One step at a time. So this is going to be the start of the tkinter modules and maybe later on either in this one or maybe in another repo I'll go with a PyQt modules. I want to build some apps that I need for personal work. So I will soon be working on building them as well.

Gotta learn a lot. 

- The fundamentals of python gui programming
- Move on to saving data in files
- The move on to creating connections with the database
- Probably will have to build an import and export modules for ensuring data migration and ingestion
- A proper session management (maybe) using login credentials for security
- Software Design
- UI/UX Design
- Maybe a bumch more stuff

Gonna figure it out more as I go.
I will primarily be using VS Code for Python as I use it to learn Node JS too and Python version 3.9.x
Without further ado lets get this show on the road.
